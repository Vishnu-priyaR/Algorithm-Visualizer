# A* Algorithum Implementation

The Python project utilizes the Pygame library to create an algorithm visualizer for the A* pathfinding algorithm. Pygame is used for visualizing the behavior of algorithms. With this visualizer, users can mark start and end points on a grid, add walls to simulate obstacles, and observe the A* algorithm in action as it dynamically finds the shortest path.

# What is A* Path Finding Algorithm?

The A* algorithm is a widely used pathfinding algorithm employed in graph traversal and artificial intelligence applications. It efficiently determines the shortest path between two points on a graph or grid while considering the cost of each path. A* employs a heuristic function to estimate the cost from the current node to the goal, guiding the search toward the most promising paths. It is commonly used in robotics, video games, and geographic information systems for optimal route planning.
